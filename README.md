# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains HTML and CSS Projects: 
 - One-page website2, where I talk about tea using mainly html. 
 - The Space Station assignment, which is styled using CSS and has features such as a navbar and a form. 
 - Academy Cinemas, also styled using CSS and makes use of features such as columns, inserting links, formatting text in cards, and buttons. 
 - Challenge 5, where I followed all 10 of the challenges in the module which included hovering texts, inserting columns and colour-changing links. 
 - Tiffany's portfolio, which includes a navbar, video playing behind some headings, greyscale, and hover effects.
